Really worth it!\\nEverything we had were executed really well. The gyozas were very meaty and juicy, perfect with the yuzu ponzu sauce. As for the side dishes, I especially loved the Eggplant and pork slices stir fried with miso, and the nanban chicken.\\nThe Eggplant and pork slices were all very tender, and we loved how miso gave so much umami and flavour!\\nThe nanban chicken was hot, crispy, so tender and succulent and perfect with the mayo sauce. This is highly addictive.\\nReally such a satisfying meal! We had nothing but compliments for all the dishes. Definitely will be back!\\nreview_link: https://abc.xyz/review4\\nnum_stars: 5\\nvenue_name: Dumpling King\\nvenue_url: https://abc.xyz/4\\nvenue_price: ~$20/pax\\nvenue_tag: Japanese', metadata={'source': 'https://abc.xyz/review4', 'row': 3})]"
